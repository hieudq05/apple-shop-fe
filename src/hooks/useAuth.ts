// Assuming AuthContext is defined in '../contexts/AuthContext'

// You would need to export AuthContext from AuthContext.tsx for this to work.
// import { AuthContext, AuthContextType } from '../contexts/AuthContext';


// This is a placeholder. For the above AuthContext.tsx, useAuth is already defined there.
// If you create a separate AuthContext (e.g. const AuthContext = createContext...),
// you would use it here.

// Example if AuthContext was exported:
/*
import { useContext } from 'react';
import { AuthContext, AuthContextType } from '../contexts/AuthContext'; // Adjust path as needed

export const useAuth = (): AuthContextType => {
    const context = useContext(AuthContext);
    if (context === undefined) {
        throw new Error('useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider');
    }
    return context;
};

// For now, as useAuth is in AuthContext.tsx, this file can be a placeholder or not created.
// If you want to use this file, ensure AuthContext is exported from its definition file.
export {}; // Placeholder to make it a module
